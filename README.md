# projetL3_S2_Pathfinding

This is one of my last project during my third years of Bachelor's degree . I studied the problem of pathfinding, mentioned in particular in AI as well as operational research. In this approach to obtain the shortest path.

I had to study Dijsktra and A*, two resolution algorithms, with numerical instances as lines of character representing a map.

To launch the project:
    - The file conversion.jl contains a parser to convert a file in the map folder.
    - Include the main.jl file in the REPL.
    - Then launch the main function with the main parameter(“filename”, start_point , end_point). 
      (type of point: Tuple{Int64,Int64})
    - You will have the choice beetween what do you want to run.
